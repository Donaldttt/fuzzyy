# Fuzzyy

A fuzzy finder for files, strings, help documents and many other things.

It utilizes Vim's native matchfuzzypos function and popup window feature.

Fuzzyy strives to provide an out-of-box experience by using pre-installed
programs to handle complex tasks.

## Requirements

- Vim >= 9.0 (plugin is written in vim9scipt, Vim 9+ required, NeoVim not
  supported)

## Suggested dependencies
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (used for FuzzyGrep and
  FuzzyFiles if installed, faster than the defaults and respects gitignore)
- [vim-devicons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons) (used to show
  [devicons](https://devicon.dev/) when listing files if installed)

## Optional dependencies
- [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (used for FuzzyGrep if
  ripgrep not installed)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (used for FuzzyFiles if ripgrep not installed)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) (used for FuzzyGrep and FuzzyFiles when inside git
  repo and no alternative dependency installed)

## Install

Any plugin manager will work, or you can use Vim's built-in package support:

For vim-plug
```vim
Plug 'Donaldttt/fuzzyy'
```

As Vim package
```
git clone https://github.com/Donaldttt/fuzzyy ~/.vim/pack/Donaldttt/start/fuzzyy
```

- For FuzzyGrep and FuzzyInBuffer, you can define a keymap like this to search the
word under cursor.
    ```vim
        nnoremap <leader>fw :FuzzyGrep <C-R><C-W><CR>
    ```
- FuzzyGrep requires one of `rg`, `ag`, `grep` or `FINDSTR` commands. If neither
  `rg` or `ag` are installed it will also use `git-grep` when in a git repo.

- FuzzyFiles requires one of `rg`, `fd`, `find` or `powershell` commands. If
  neither `rg` or `fd` are installed it will also use `git-ls-files` when in a
  git repo.

## Navigation

Arrow keys or `ctrl + p`/ `ctrl + n` moves up/down the menu

`ctrl + u`/`ctrl + d` moves up/down the buffer by half page in preview window

`ctrl + i`/`ctrl + f` moves up/down the buffer by one line in preview window

You can set `g:fuzzyy_keymaps` to change these defaults.

Navigation with the mouse is also supported. A single mouse click in the menu
window moves the cursor line, double click selects a line. The mouse wheel can
be used to scroll the preview window, but not the menu window.

### Command Specific keymaps
- FuzzyHighlights
    - `ctrl + k` toggle white preview background color

- FuzzyMru, FuzzyMruCwd
    - `ctrl + k` toggle between all MRU files and CWD only

- FuzzyBuffers, FuzzyFiles, FuzzyGitFiles, FuzzyGrep, FuzzyMru, FuzzyMruCwd
    - `ctrl + s` open selected file in horizontal split
    - `ctrl + v` open selected file in vertical split
    - `ctrl + t` open selected file in new tab page

## Default mappings

You can set `g:fuzzyy_enable_mappings = 0` to disable default mappings

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fb :FuzzyBuffers<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fc :FuzzyCommands<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>ff :FuzzyFiles<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fg :FuzzyGrep<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fh :FuzzyHelp<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fi :FuzzyInBuffer<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fm :FuzzyMru<CR>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>fr :FuzzyMruCwd<CR>
```

Fuzzyy will not overwrite any existing mappings from your vimrc when adding
default mappings

## Options

```vim
" Set to 0 to disable default mappings
" Default to 1
let g:fuzzyy_enable_mappings = 1

" Show devicons when listing files (e.g. FuzzyFiles, FuzzyBuffers)
" Requires vim-devicons, see https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons
" Default to 1 (show devicons if installed), set to 0 to always disable
let g:fuzzyy_devicons = 1

" Enable dropdown theme (prompt at top rather than bottom)
" Default to 0
let g:fuzzyy_dropdown = 0

" Fuzzyy avoids opening files in windows containing special buffers, like
" buffers created by file explorer plugins or help and quickfix buffers.
" Use this to add exceptions, the match is on either buftype or filetype.
" Defaults to ['netrw'] (Netrw is Vim's built-in file explorer plugin)
let g:fuzzyy_reuse_windows = ['netrw']
" Example usage
let g:fuzzyy_reuse_windows = ['netrw', 'bufexplorer', 'mru', 'terminal']

" Make FuzzyFiles & FuzzyGrep respect .gitignore
" only work when
" 1. inside a git repository and git is installed
" 2. or either rg or fd is installed for FuzzyFiles
" 3. or either rg or ag is installed for FuzzyGrep
" Default to 1
let g:fuzzyy_respect_gitignore = 1
" This option can also be set specifically for FuzzyFiles and/or FuzzyGrep using
" g:fuzzyy_files_respect_gitignore and g:fuzzyy_grep_respect_gitignore

" Make FuzzyFiles & FuzzyGrep include hidden files
" Only applied when
" 1. rg, fd or PowerShell Get-ChildItem used with FuzzyFiles
" 2. rg or ag used with FuzzyGrep
" Default to 1
let g:fuzzyy_include_hidden = 1
" This option can also be set specifically for FuzzyFiles and/or FuzzyGrep using
" g:fuzzyy_files_include_hidden and g:fuzzyy_grep_include_hidden

" Make FuzzyFiles & FuzzyGrep follow symbolic links
" Not applied when using git-ls-files, git-grep or FINDSTR
" Default to 0
let g:fuzzyy_follow_symlinks = 0
" This option can also be set specifically for FuzzyFiles and/or FuzzyGrep using
" g:fuzzyy_files_follow_symlinks and g:fuzzyy_grep_follow_symlinks

" Patterns to find a project root in supported commands, e.g. FuzzyFilesRoot
" These commands find a "root" directory to use as the working directory by
" walking up the direcrory tree looking for any match of these glob patterns.
" Default is intentionally conservative, using common VCS root markers only
let g:fuzzyy_root_patterns = ['.git', '.hg', '.svn']
" Example usage
let g:fuzzyy_root_patterns = ['.git', 'package.json', 'pyproject.toml']

" Make FuzzyFiles, FuzzyGrep, and FuzzyMru always exclude files/directories
" This applies whether .gitignore is respected or not
" The following are the defaults
let g:fuzzyy_exclude_file = ['*.swp', 'tags']
let g:fuzzyy_exclude_dir = ['.git', '.hg', '.svn']
" Set options specifically for FuzzyFiles, FuzzyGrep, and FuzzyMru using
" g:fuzzyy_files_exclude_file, g:fuzzyy_grep_exclude_file etc.

" Add custom ripgrep options for FuzzyFiles & FuzzyGrep
" These are appended to the generated options
" Default to []
let g:fuzzyy_ripgrep_options = []
" Example usage
let g:fuzzyy_ripgrep_options = [
  \ "--no-config",
  \ "--max-filesize=1M",
  \ "--no-ignore-parent",
  \ "--ignore-file " . expand('~/.ignore')
  \ ]
" This option can also be set specifically for FuzzyFiles and/or FuzzyGrep using
" g:fuzzyy_files_ripgrep_options and g:fuzzyy_grep_ripgrep_options

" Change navigation keymaps
" The following are the defaults
let g:fuzzyy_keymaps = {
\     'menu_up': ["\<c-p>", "\<Up>"],
\     'menu_down': ["\<c-n>", "\<Down>"],
\     'menu_select': ["\<CR>"],

\     'exit': ["\<Esc>", "\<c-c>", "\<c-[>"], " exit fuzzyy
\ }

" FuzzyBuffers will exclude the buffers in this list. Buffers not included in
" Vim's buffer list are excluded by default, so this is only necessary for
" buffers included in Vim's buffer list, but you want hidden by FuzzyBuffers
" Default to []
let g:fuzzyy_buffers_exclude = []

" FuzzyBuffer keymap for commands speicific to FuzzyBuffers
" The following are the defaults
let g:fuzzyy_buffers_keymap = {
\    'delete_buffer': "",
\    'close_buffer': "\<c-l>",
\ }

" Window layout configuration, customize by setting g:fuzzyy_window_layout
" The general defaults for window layout options are:
"     'preview': 1,         " 1 means enable preview window, 0 means disable
"     'preview_ratio': 0.5, " 0.5 means preview window will take 50% of the layout
"     'width': 0.8,         " 0.8 means total width of the layout will take 80% of the screen
"     'height': 0.8,        " 0.8 means total height of the layout will take 80% of the screen
"     'xoffset': v:none     " x offset of the windows, 0.1 means 10% from left of the screen
"     'yoffset': v:none     " x offset of the windows, 0.1 means 10% from top of the screen
" preview is ignored by commands that do not support it, e.g. FuzzyCmdHistory
" x and y offsets are by default calculated to center the windows on the screen
" width, height, and x and y offsets > 0 and < 1 are resolved as percentages
" width, height, and x and y offsets >= 1 are fixed numbers of lines and cols
" invalid values for preview_ratio, width, height, and x and y offsets are ignored
" This configuration is also customised per selector, with the following defaults
\ {
\    'files': {},
\    'grep': {},
\    'buffers': {},
\    'mru': {},
\    'highlights': {},
\    'cmdhistory': {
\        'width': 0.6,
\    },
\    'colors': {
\        'width': 0.25,
\        'xoffset': 0.7,
\    },
\    'commands': {
\        'width': 0.4,
\    },
\    help: {
\        'preview_ratio': 0.6
\    },
\    'inbuffer': {},
\ }
" e.g. You can disable preview window for FuzzyFiles and friends with:
let g:fuzzyy_window_layout = { 'files': { 'preview': 0 } }
" or you change the width of the preview window for FuzzyColors with:
let g:fuzzyy_window_layout = { 'colors': { 'width': 0.4 } }
" Note: values set in g:fuzzyy_window_layout are merged with the defaults

" async step processing configuration, normally you can leave this alone, but...
" Fuzzyy mimics async processing to fuzzy match in batches, which avoids
" problems running Vim's built in fuzzy matching on massive lists at once
" The size of these batches is the async step value, which defaults to 10,000
" This default should work well for most developer workstations, but you might
" want to reduce if you notice a lack of responsiveness on low spec machines
let g:fuzzyy_async_step = 10000

" It is also possible to modify the colors used for highlighting
" The defaults are shown below, you can change them in your vimrc
" See :help :highlight if you are unfamiliar with Vim highlighting
highlight default link fuzzyyCursor Search
highlight default link fuzzyyNormal Normal
highlight default link fuzzyyBorder Normal
highlight default link fuzzyyMatching Special
highlight default link fuzzyyPreviewMatch CurSearch
