Fuzzyy has been renamed to Fuzzbox :-)

Your existing Fuzzyy configuration is supported, but deprecated, so you should
update it when you get a moment. This is simple, just replace `g:fuzzyy_foo`
with `g:fuzzbox_foo` etc. in your vimrc

The Fuzzyy GitHub repository at https://github.com/Donaldttt/fuzzyy has been
renamed and transferred to https://github.com/vim-fuzzbox/fuzzbox.vim

Your existing plugin manager should continue to work fine, as git operations
like `git clone` and `git fetch` will be redirected to the new location.

However, you should update your plugin configuration to obtain Fuzzbox from
the new location. The simplest way to do this is to remove the old Fuzzyy
plugin installation and replace it with Fuzzbox. See |fuzzbox-install|

If you prefer to do things manually, you can just rename the directory and
update the git configuration to change the origin url, e.g.
>
  cd <path-to-plugins-dir>
  mv fuzzyy fuzzbox
  cd fuzzbox
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/vim-fuzzbox/fuzzbox.vim.git
<
If you had gotten funky with Fuzzyy and created some custom commands or
written custom selectors, you'll need to update any imports or references
to autoload functions with their Fuzzbox equivalent. Just replace `fuzzyy`
with `fuzzbox` in import or autoload paths and things should work again.
